  "reason": "用户反馈 done 挂起且无异常，需要找出未完成路径。",
  "findings": [
    "lib/watermark_kit_method_channel.dart: composeVideo sets up Completer and StreamController, then unawaited(WatermarkApi().composeVideo(req)). The completer only completes via callbacks (_CallbacksImpl.onVideoCompleted/onVideoError) or via the .then fallback when the pigeon Future resolves.",
    "If WatermarkApi().composeVideo never resolves (e.g., platform side never replies) and callbacks never fire, completer.future hangs with no timeout.",
    "If native processing stalls without sending onVideoError/onVideoCompleted, Dart side has no guard to emit an error."
